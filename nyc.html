                The Empire State Building is a supertall skyscraper in New York City, in the United States. It had been the tallest building in the world for a very long time (40 years). The uses of the Empire State Building are varied, while commonly being used for office spaces, observation decks, broadcasting, it also at times served as a wedding location, filming site, and the site for Vertical Marathon. In the same time as a landmark in New York City or America, the upper portion of the building will always be lit with different colors which represent different festivals or events.

                Wall Street Bull is a three-and-a-half-ton bronze sculpture from artist Arturo Di Modica that sits proudly in New York City's financial district.  The bull symbolizes "the power of the American people" and represents the spirit of New York, where anyone can come, work hard and succeed.  The bull is also a symbol of a strong stock market in which participants are optimistic and confident.

                Brooklyn Bridge is a suspension/cable-stay hybrid bridge in New York City that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn. It is one of the oldest suspension bridges in United States (completed in 1883) and a first steel-wire suspension bridge in the world. The bridge’s construction took 14 years and cost $15 million (more than $320 million in today’s dollars). At least two dozen people died in the process, including its original designer. Now more than 125 years old, this iconic feature of the New York City skyline still carries roughly 150,000 vehicles and pedestrians every day.

                Vessel is the 150-foot, bowl-shaped, honeycomb-like interactive artwork dubbed Vessel that centres Hudson Yards — the largest private real estate project in the US, situated on the far west side of Manhattan. Its interactive structure is intended to be climbed, explored, and experienced. comprising 154 interconnecting flights of stairs, the installation will offer a variety of ways to engage with the city’s urban landscape. in total, the design — with its almost 2,500 individual steps and 80 landings — will offer a mile’s worth of pathway above a sprawling public garden.
